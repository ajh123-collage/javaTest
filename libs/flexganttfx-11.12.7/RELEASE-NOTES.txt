Release: 11.12.5, Date: March 30th 2022
----------------------------------------------------------------

** BUG FIXES

   ** FLEXFX-359 - Now line is not straight after zooming in
   ** FLEXFX-356 - yOffset is not working when ChartLayout max and min values are the same.
   ** FLEXFX-357 - Auto hide scrollbar causes weird behaviour.
   ** FLEXFX-358 - With turned off auto hide TimelineScrollbar position is fixed.


----------------------------------------------------------------
Release: 11.12.4, Date: April 21st 2021
----------------------------------------------------------------

** ENHANCEMENTS

   ** The "horizon" scrollbar now ensures that the horizon end date will be shown on
      the right edge of the graphics area. Before this change the user could scroll the
      horizon end time to be on the left edge of the viewport.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Release: 11.12.3, Date: March 2021
----------------------------------------------------------------

** NEW

   ** Added methods on Timeline for showing / scrolling to a given date or a given zoned date
      time. Before it was only possible to pass an instant.
   ** Added an option on GanttChartBase to specify the scrollbar type to use for scrolling
      horizontally in time. So far the scrollbar allowed for infinite scrolling. This version
      adds a standard ("normal") scrollbar that allows the user to scroll within a given time
      horizon. Applications can also choose to completely remove the scrollbar.
   ** Added an option on GanttChartBase to specify whether the horizontal scrollbars on the
      left-hand side and the right-hand side should auto-hide when not used. Auto-hiding
      was actually the behaviour all the time. Being able to specify that the scrollbars
      should "not" auto-hide is the new feature.

** ENHANCEMENTS

    ** The RowCanvas class now has a full set of snapXYZ() methods and the alignment of the
       canvas itself and of the activities shown by the canvas have been improved.

** BUGS

    ** Fixed an issue related to daylight saving time and grid lines. When the timeline was
       showing "hours" granularity with a step rate of 3 or 6 then the grid lines became
       misaligned. The GridLinesLayer now checks whether a DST was crossed while drawing the
       grid lines.
    ** Row controls are now being recreated when the row model object changes so that the controls
       will work for the new row instead of the old row.
    ** Showing a row header UI could cause flickering when rows were added or removed. Setting
       the min size of those header nodes to zero width and height fixed the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Release: 11.12.2, Date: March 3rd, 2021
----------------------------------------------------------------

** CHANGES

   ** Added a flag called "inverse" to the LassoInfo class. The flag indicates whether
      the lasso was created in inverse direction, meaning the end time of the lasso was
      actually BEFORE the start time of the lasso when the user released the mouse.
   ** The CSS styles .dateline-cell-first and .dateline-cell-last are no longer supported
      due to the new buffer concepts.

** BUGS

    ** Fixed a styling issue that caused the graphics view header on the right-hand
       side to become misaligned with the table header on the left-hand side. It was
       two pixels less high.
    ** Made sure the time label shown in the first dateline cell remains visible as
       long as possible. A regression that was introduced with the new buffer concepts
       caused the label to disappear very quickly and depending on the zoom level it
       became hard to determine that start date of the dateline.


----------------------------------------------------------------
Release: 11.12.1, August 17th, 2020
----------------------------------------------------------------

** BUGS

   ** Fixed difference in selection behaviour between Mac and Windows in combination
      with context menu / popup trigger. Problem was: on Mac the mouse "pressed" event
      gets marked as a popup trigger. On Windows it is the mouse "released" event.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Release: 11.12.0, May 14th, 2020
----------------------------------------------------------------

** CHANGES

   ** Started using system cursors for editing operations in the graphics area. For example
      Cursor.E_RESIZE to change the end time of an activity. "Old" cursors are still there
      and can be enabled by calling RowCanvasBehaviour.useCustomCursors().
   ** Added ability to resize a row / change a row height interactively via the row headers.
      This gives the user the same ability for resizing as available in the row headers of
      the tree table.
   ** Consolidated license keys for Java 8 and Java 11+ version of FlexGanttFX. The versions
      11.12.x and 8.12.x will now be usable with the same key.
   ** Moved the timezone label from the dateline to the timeline, as it was not working
      anymore in combination with a dateline buffer > 0.
   ** Removed support for dateline scrolling events. These events could not be produced
      correctly anymore after introducing the dateline buffer concept. Added new "visible
      time interval" read-only property on Timeline, which can be used instead.
   ** Enhanced RadarView's performance. Also added auto-redraw upon activity changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Release: 11.11.0, May 2020 (Performance / StillCorona Release)
----------------------------------------------------------------

>>> THIS IS A MAJOR RELEASE: YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE A NEW LICENSE
>>> IF YOU HAVEN'T SUBSCRIBED TO THE MAINTENANCE PLAN.

** CHANGES / NEW FEATURES

	** Stopped using PNG icon files. Replaced with Material Design Icons from Ikonli.
	** Added new method to show / hide links. Added new toolbar button to trigger it.
	** Changed default font size used in timeline and dateline.
	** Decreased default height of table header and timeline, now that we use smaller font.
	** Added new "zoom mode" selector to toolbar
	** Added new "show / hide scale / row header" button to toolbar
	** New default value for "show hover interval" is "false"
	** Added new RowHeader concept to replace things like the ScaleLayer. Renamed previous
	   RowHeader class to RowHeaderColumn.

** BUGS

	** Fixed bug where grid lines were drawn from previous time unit after zoom operation
	** Fixed bug where calendar entries (e.g. weekend days) were still drawn even when
       currently displayed primary time unit does not want to display them.
	** Fixed bug where too many listeners were added to the timeline when adding and
       removing Gantt chart instances to a multi Gantt chart container.
	** Minimized number of canvas redraws for RowCanvas and LinksCanvas by listening to
       layout pulses from the scene and then drawing instead of immediately drawing all
       the time. Very similar to "requestLayout" calls, that do not immediately lay out
       controls but wait for a good point and time and batch multiple calls to one.
    ** Fixed text color used inside the context menu in the upper left corner of the tree
       table (used for showing / hiding columns, etc...).
    ** Added missing support for alpha channel / opacity to LinksCanvas / links drawing.


----------------------------------------------------------
Release: 11.10.0, March 2020 (Performance / Corona Release)
----------------------------------------------------------

** Replaced LinksPane with LinksCanvas. Links are now drawn via CanvasAPI (much faster).
** Replaced ObservableList of ActivityLinks with an IntervalTree for faster lookup.
** ActivityLink can now carry an optional user object.
** Custom link renderers can be registered on GraphicsBase.
** Reworked layout code of DatelineScale to work properly with latest CSS changes in JavaFX.
** Introduced buffers for RowCanvas and DatelineScale to reduce repaints.

-----------------------------------
Release: 11.9.1, October 24th, 2019
-----------------------------------

** Bug fix: re-enabled drawing of activity links.
** Re-added missing API docs / javadocs.

-----------------------------------
Release: 11.9.0, October 23rd, 2019
-----------------------------------

** See Release 8.9.0 plus modularity plus JavaFX 11+ support.

** The demo folder and the applications inside of it were removed as building standalone
   and executable JAR files have become quite difficult to do with the new module system and
   the fact that JavaFX is now an external dependency.
